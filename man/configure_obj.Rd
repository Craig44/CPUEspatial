\arguments{
\item{data}{SpatialPointsDataFrame, which contains response variable and covariates for glmm analysis mut contain column 'area'}

\item{projection_df}{SpatialPointsDataFrameneeds to have the same variable names (colnames) as data. Should supply variable values for all projection cells over all time steps}

\item{mesh}{an inla.mesh object that has been created before this function is applied}

\item{family}{0 = Gaussian, 1 = Binomial, 2 = Gamma, 3 = Poisson, 4 = Negative Binomial}

\item{link}{link function 0 = log, 1 = logit, 2 = probit, 3 = inverse, 4 = identity}

\item{include_omega}{boolean time-varying spatial GF}

\item{include_epsilon}{boolean time-invariant spatial GF}

\item{response_variable_label}{character relating to a column name in data}

\item{time_variable_label}{character relating to a column names needs to be an integer variable}

\item{catchability_covariates}{string vector relating to a column names needs to be an integer variable}

\item{catchability_covariate_type}{string vector indicating if the factor, numeric}

\item{spatial_covariates}{vector of strings relating to a column names needs to be an integer variable}

\item{spatial_covariate_type}{string vector indicating if the factor, numeric}

\item{spline_catchability_covariates}{string vector}

\item{spline_spatial_covariates}{vector of strings indicating column name}

\item{linear_basis}{0 = apply triangulation sparse matrix approach, 1 = Nearest Neighbour}

\item{apply_preferential_sampling}{whether to jointly model observation location}

\item{preference_model_type}{integer 0 = Dinsdale approach, 1 = LGCP lattice approach}

\item{projection_raster_layer}{a RasterLayer object only required if apply_preferential_sampling = TRUE, and preference_model_type == 1. Should be the same resolution as projection_df. Used to collate sample locations. The data slot should have vaules 0 = cell not in projection grid or 1 = active projection cell
TODO add whether we want to use Nearest Neighbour approach NN.}

\item{trace_level}{'none' don't print any information, 'low' print steps in the function 'medium' print gradients of TMB optimisation, 'high' print parameter candidates as well as gradients during oprimisation.}

given a data frame and some user defined settings will return an TMB object that represents either a GLM, or geo-statistical model.
is implied in this model, otherwise you could just use the standard GLM approach
